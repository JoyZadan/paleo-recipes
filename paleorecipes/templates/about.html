                            A paleo diet is a dietary plan based on foods similar to what might have been eaten during
                            the
                            Paleolithic era,
                            which dates from approximately 2.5 million to 10,000 years ago.

                            A paleo diet typically includes lean meats, fish, fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds â€” foods
                            that in the past could be
                            obtained by hunting and gathering. A paleo diet limits foods that became common when farming
                            emerged about 10,000 years ago.
                            These foods include dairy products, legumes and grains.
