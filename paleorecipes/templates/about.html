        <h2 class="text-white">Is the Paleo diet, an eating plan modeled on prehistoric human diets, right for modern humans?</h2>
        <p class="text-white">
            A paleo diet is a dietary plan based on foods similar to what might have been eaten during the Paleolithic era,
            which dates from approximately 2.5 million to 10,000 years ago.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white">
            A paleo diet typically includes lean meats, fish, fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds â€” foods that in the past could be
            obtained by hunting and gathering. A paleo diet limits foods that became common when farming emerged about 10,000 years ago.
            These foods include dairy products, legumes and grains.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white">
            Other names for a paleo diet include Paleolithic diet, Stone Age diet, hunter-gatherer diet and caveman diet.
